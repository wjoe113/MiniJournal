In this assignemnt I created a miniature journal. In the journal the user can write with a pen or highlighter,
erase by point and stroke, create symbols, load images as backgrounds, save ink strokes, laod ink strokes clear
the canvas, recognize text, and compute equations using the calculator.

Basic Functionality:
- Press the "load", "save", or "clear" buttons to load, save, or clear your work. The user's notes are saved
as .isf files. All strokes in saved .isf files are visible, lasso-able, and editable once loaded in to
the journal.
- Press the "graph paper" button to turn on and off a graph paper background.
- Press the "load background" button to load a background image of your choice.
- Press the "exit" button to exit the application.

Pen Functionality:
- Press any of the 5 pen color preset buttons to change the color of the pen to that preset. The current color is
displayed below the highlighters, next to the pen size slider. Use the pen size slider to change the size of the
pen/highlighter.
- Press any of the 3 highlighter color preset buttons to change the pen in to a highlighter of that color.
- Press the "point" eraser button to erase by point. Press the "stroke" eraser button to erase by stroke.
- Press the "lasso" button to turn the pen in to a lasso and make stroke selections. Selected strokes can be moved,
scaled, and deleted.

Advanced Functionality:
- With the pen, draw at least three strokes back-and-forth across the ink you want to erase. Highlighters can be
erased, but not erased with (intentional).
- Once a stroke has been lasso'd, press the "convert to text" button to convert the selected strokes in to text.
Good handwritting is not required but helpful.

Symbol Collection Functionailty:
- Write anything and tap on the inkCanvas to recognize what you drew.

Calculator:
- If you include an equal sign ("=") at the end of an equation (including trig equations) and tap the canvas it will
solve the equation. Do not include parentheses, the calculator will automatically perform the correct order of
operations. If you include text in the equation (not including trig functions) it will tell you to retry writing the equation.

Thanks for reading!
