Assignment1 CAP6105:Pen-Based User Interfaces

In this assignemnt I created a miniature journal. In the journal the user can write with a pen or highlighter,
erase by point and stroke, create symbols, load images as backgrounds, and save, clear, and load their work.

Basic Functionality:
- Press the "load", "save", or "clear" buttons to load, save, or clear your work. The user's notes are saved
as .isf files. All strokes in saved .isf files are visible, lasso-able, and editable once loaded in to
the journal.
- Press the "graph paper" button to turn on and off a graph paper background.
- Press the "load background" button to load a background image of your choice.
- Press the "exit" button to exit the application.

Pen Functionality:
- Press any of the 5 pen color preset buttons to change the color of the pen to that preset. The current color is
displayed below the highlighters, next to the pen size slider. Use the pen size slider to change the size of the
pen/highlighter.
- Press any of the 3 highlighter color preset buttons to change the pen in to a highlighter of that color.
- Press the "point" eraser button to erase by point. Press the "stroke" eraser button to erase by stroke.
- Press the "lasso" button to turn the pen in to a lasso and make stroke selections. Selected strokes can be moved,
scaled, and deleted.

Advanced Functionality:
- With the pen, draw at least three strokes back-and-forth across the ink you want to erase. Highlighters can be
erased, but not erased with (intentional).
- Once a stroke has been lasso'd, press the "convert to text" button to convert the selected strokes in to text.
Good handwritting is not required but helpful.

Symbol Collection Functionailty:
- Write anything and tap on the inkCanvas to recognize what you drew. Also, if you include an "=" at the end of an
equation (including trig) it will solve the equation. No paretheses.

Everything works!
